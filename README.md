# Calculator in React

Download the .zip and unziped it or clone the project

**cd ReactCalculator**

**npm start**

I made a folder _src/calculator_ and another _public/calculator_

So, if you want, you can just use the component <Calculator /> in your own projects.

Any feedback or suggestion will be appreciated. ^^
